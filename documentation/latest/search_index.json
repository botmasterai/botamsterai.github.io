It was meant to be used both in small scale and large scale projects. Its purpose is to integrate your chatbot into a variety of messaging channels - currently packages have been written for Facebook Messenger, Slack, Twitter DM, Telegram and socket.io. Using botmaster will look something like this in code:\nconst Botmaster = require('botmaster');\nconst MessengerBot = require('botmaster-messenger');\nconst SlackBot = require('botmaster-slack');\nconst SocketIoBot = require('botmaster-socket.io');\nconst TwitterBot = require('botmaster-twitter-dm');\nconst TelegramBot = require('botmaster-telegram');\n\nconst config = require('./config'); // your config file with your credentials etc\n\nconst botmaster = new Botmaster();\n\nbotmaster.addBot(new MessengerBot(config.messengerSettings));\nbotmaster.addBot(new SlackBot(config.slackSettings));\nbotmaster.addBot(new SocketioBot({\n  id: 'mySocket.ioId', // whatever you want it to be for socket.io bots\n}));\nbotmaster.addBot(new TwitterBot(config.twitterSettings));\nbotmaster.addBot(new TelegramBot(config.telegramSettings));\n\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'Update replier', // this is optional, but should ideally describe what your middleware does\n  controller: (bot, update) => {\n    return bot.reply(update, 'Right back at you!');\n  }\n});\n\nBotmaster is platform agnostic\nBotmaster is platform agnostic in two important ways. Firstly, out of the box, developers can have bots running on Facebook Messenger, Slack, Twitter DM, Telegram and their personal webapp/app via socket.io with not only a standardized text message format, but also a standardized attachment format. Secondly, BotMaster makes no assumptions about the back-end bot itself - you can write code that allows BotMaster to call conversational engines such as IBM Watson's conversation API, open source frameworks or even write the conversation engine yourself.\nBotmaster's Philosophy\nIts philosophy is to minimize the amount of code developers have to write in order to create 1-on-1 conversational chatbots that work on multiple platforms. It does so by defining a standard with respect to what format messages take and how 1-on-1 conversations occur. Messages to/from the various messaging channels supported are all mapped onto this botmaster standard, meaning the code you write is much reduced when compared to a set of point:point integrations.\n"},"getting-started/":{"url":"getting-started/","title":"Getting started","keywords":"","body":"GETTING STARTED\nInstallation\nQuickstart\nWebhooks\n"},"getting-started/installation.html":{"url":"getting-started/installation.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"Installation\nMake sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

Support for other platforms can be added\nvery easily as will be described later.\nBecause we only want to get acquainted with Botmaster, we'll build a very naive and simple bot that doesn't really do much. i.e. with no support for natural language understanding, conversational flows etc... We just want to expose how botmaster works here.\nIt'll look something like this on Facebook Messenger:\n\nAnd like this on Twitter (DMs):\n\nThis mini-tutorial assumes that you have already installed botmaster as documented in the installation guide: here.\nStep 0: Install bot class packages\nOn its own, the botmaster package (botmaster core) doesn't really do much. We need to install packages that leverage it in order to try it out. We do:\nyarn add botmaster-messenger\nyarn add botmaster-twitter-dm\n\nor for npm:\nnpm install --save botmaster-messenger\nnpm install --save botmaster-twitter-dm\nStep 1: Setup\nIn the folder in which you installed botmaster, create an app.js file and put the following lines in it:\nconst Botmaster = require('botmaster');\n\nconst botmaster = new Botmaster();\n\nNothing special is going on here. We're just requiring the Botmaster class (exposed via the botmaster package) and creating a new instance of Botmaster.\nNow, in order for Botmaster to manage out bots, we obviously need to create at least one bot. We'll go on and create couple. One Facebook Messenger bot and one Twitter DM bot.\n\nTo complete the following steps, you will need to gather valid credentials for the platforms you want to use. Read the following small guides for Facebook Messenger and Twitter DMs if you don't have credentials for these platforms yet:\nmessenger, twitter. Other guides are also available in the messaging-platforms section.\n\nconst MessengerBot = require('botmaster-messenger');\n// you can also use: import MessengerBot from 'botmaster-messenger' if  using ES6 modules via Babel\nconst TwitterBot = require('botmaster-twitter-dm');\n\nconst messengerSettings = {\n  credentials: {\n    verifyToken: 'YOUR verifyToken',\n    pageToken: 'YOUR pageToken',\n    fbAppSecret: 'YOUR fbAppSecret',\n  },\n  webhookEndpoint: 'webhook1234', // botmaster will mount this webhook on https://Your_Domain_Name/messenger/webhook1234\n};\n\nconst twitterSettings = {\n  credentials: {\n    consumerKey: 'YOUR consumerKey',\n    consumerSecret: 'YOUR consumerSecret',\n    accessToken: 'YOUR accessToken',\n    accessTokenSecret: 'YOUR accessTokenSecret',\n  }\n}\n\nconst messengerBot = new MessengerBot(messengerSettings);\nconst twitterBot = new TwitterBot(twitterSettings);\n\nThere seems to be quite a bit going on here. Let's look at it all line by line:\nOn the first two lines we get the MessengerBot and TwitterBot classes we added as dependencies in Step 0.\nNext, settings objects for both platforms are created: namely the messengerSettings and twitterSettings objects. To see how to gather the necessary credentials, have a look at these small guides: messenger, twitter\nIn the messengerSettings object, the webhookEndpoint parameter simply indicates to Botmaster what endpoint we want the Facebook Messenger messages to come into. I.e. if you host your Botmaster app on, say, \"https://somebotmasterapp.com\", Messages coming in from Facebook Messenger will hit: \"https://somebotmasterapp.com/messenger/webhook1234\". This works because Botmaster is built on top of express.js. Read more about webhooks and how to make them work locally here.\nAs it stands, these bot objects don't really have much to do with our previously create botmaster one. We want to be able to manage them from the botmaster object. So we will now add (or mount) these newly created bot objects onto the botmaster object we created previously. So right after these few lines, enter the following:\nbotmaster.addBot(messengerBot);\nbotmaster.addBot(twitterBot);\n\nThese lines simply indicate to botmaster that it should be notified of all activity going on within our two bot objects. But still, botmaster doesn't actually do anything yet. let's change this!\nStep 2: Acting on updates\nIn order for botmaster to be be able to do anything based on any activity going on (i.e. users sending messages to your bots), we'll need to add incoming middleware to our bot (this is not completely unlike express or Koa middleware). So when a user sends a message to one of our bots. It looks like this:\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'my-incoming-middleware',\n  controller: (bot, update) => {\n    console.log(update);\n  }\n});\n\nAt this point, whenever a message (or update in Botmaster semantic) is received by any of your bots, you will be printing to the console the received message. You'll also note that the callback function has a bot object associated with it. This object will be either of messengerBot or twitterBot in this example depending on what bot actually received the update\nThis is great. But what if I want to send something back to the user. Well, let's have a look.\nStep 3: sending replies\nThe easiest thing to do to have a bot that answers you is the following; replace the Step 2 code with this:\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'my-incoming-middleware',\n  controller: (bot, update) => {\n    return bot.reply(update, 'Hello World!');\n  }\n});\n\nThis really doesn't do much however. Let's try to get to something like what we saw in the pictures at the beginning of this tutorial. Let's replace this code with this:\nmyIncomingMiddlewareController = (bot, update) => {\n  if (update.message.text === 'hi' ||\n      update.message.text === 'Hi' ||\n      update.message.text === 'hello' ||\n      update.message.text === 'Hello') {\n    return bot.reply(update, 'well hi right back at you');\n  } else if (update.message.text.indexOf('weather') > -1) {\n    return bot.sendTextMessageTo('It is currently sunny in Philadelphia', update.sender.id);\n  } else {\n    const messages = ['I\\'m sorry about this.',\n                      'But it seems like I couldn\\'t understand your message.',\n                      'Could you try reformulating it?']\n    return bot.sendTextCascadeTo(messages, update.sender.id)\n  }\n};\n\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'My incoming middleware',\n  controller: myIncomingMiddlewareController,\n});\n\nWhat's going on here is really fairly straightforward. The point of this code is really to expose to you the different ways there are to send messages in botmaster. In the first conditional block, I look to see if the text from the platform says something like \"hello\", if so, answer that way using the reply helper function. However, if the message contains the word \"weather\", we reply using the sendTextMessageTo helper function. In any other situation, we reply in a cascade of text messages using the sendTextCascadeTo helper function to send multiple text messages one after the other. If you want to see all the available send helper functions available to you in Botmaster, check it out here.\nClosing Comments\nNow as mentioned at the beginning of this tutorial, this bot is not a very good or helpful bot. It's quite dumb and doesn't even leverage a lot of the Botmaster goodies like better use of middlewares, using socket.io to have a bot on your own website. Or adding support for a different bot class as mentioned here. More importantly, it doesn't really understand anything being told to it and have a look at the list of tutorials we have to see how to leverage NLU tools such as Watson Conversation, Wit.ai, Api.ai and rasa-nlu with Botmaster.\n"},"getting-started/webhooks.html":{"url":"getting-started/webhooks.html","title":"Webhooks","keywords":"","body":"Webhooks\nMost platforms rely on webhooks to work. As such, you are expected to setup webhooks on the various platforms that use them in order to use Botmaster with these platforms. In the 'Message platforms' part of this documentation, we briefly mention webhooks for Telegram and Messenger and more deeply for Slack.\nIf you are still unsure what webhooks are and how they work, within the context of chatbots, think of them as such: URL provided by you, pointing to where you expect messages and other updates to come in.\nAny platform that requires webhooks won't work without a webhookEndpoint parameter in their settings. E.g. for Telegram (using botmaster-telegram):\nconst telegramSettings = {\n  credentials: {\n    authToken: 'YOUR authToken',\n  },\n  webhookEndpoint: 'webhook1234/',\n};\n\nThis will mount your telegram webhook on: https://Your_Domain_Name:3000/telegram/webhook1234. And yes, you will need ssl in order to work with most platforms.\nAs an added layer of security, it is highly recommended that you include a sort of a code in your webhookEndpoint. I.e., rather that having this: webhookEndpoint: 'webhook/', do something more like this: webhookEndpoint: 'webhook92ywrnc9qm4qoiuthecvasdf42FG/'. This will assure that you know where the request is coming from. It is more important on Telegram than on other platforms as Telegram doesn't give us any way to verify the source of the message.\nNow we realize you will want to develop and test your code without always deploying to a server with a valid url that supports ssl.\nOn a local machine:\nWe recommend using the great localtunnel tool that proxies one of your ports to their url (with a potential wanted subdomain) using ssh.\nSimply install localtunnel on local machine:\nnpm install -g localtunnel\n\nThen run the localtunnel with a predetermined subdomain. e.g:\nlt -p 3000 -s botmastersubdomain //for example\n\n-p is the port and -s is the subdomain we want.\n-l is for the localhost we want to point to. This is useful is you are using botmaster inside of a container. For instance if using docker-machine, simply -l to your docker-machines ip and -p to the port that your container exposes.\nIn the example above, url will be: http://botmastersubdomain.localtunnel.me. Localtunnel is great and supports both ssl and non ssl request, which means we will actually wan to use: https://botmastersubdomain.localtunnel.me\nSo if you specified your messenger's bot webhook endpoint to, say, webhook1234/, you will have to set up the webhook for your demo app at:\nhttps://botmastersubdomain.localtunnel.me/messenger/webhook1234/\nFor Telegram, it would look something like this:\nhttps://botmastersubdomain.localtunnel.me/telegram/webhook1234/\nIf you keep on getting an error that looks like this:\nyour url is: https://customname.localtunnel.me\n/usr/local/lib/node_modules/localtunnel/bin/client:58\n        throw err;\n        ^\n\nError: connection refused: localtunnel.me:44404 (check your firewall settings)\n    at Socket. (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/localtunnel/lib/TunnelCluster.js:47:32)\n    at emitOne (events.js:96:13)\n    at Socket.emit (events.js:188:7)\n    at emitErrorNT (net.js:1272:8)\n    at _combinedTickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:74:11)\n    at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:98:9)\n\nThis is due to a bug in localtunnel. You can either go try out ngrok (which you will have to pay for), or try this workaround in the terminal:\n(while true; do\n  lt -p 3000 -s botmastersubdomain\ndone)\n\nor:\n( while true; do lt -p 3000 -s botmastersubdomain; done; )\n\nIf you prefer a one liner.\nThis will just restart the process whenever it crashes (which can happen very often...), making sure your webhook will always be up and listening for incoming requests.\nWhat I do in my projects is the following:\nInstall localtunnel in the project and save to dev-dependencies\nnpm install --save-dev localtunnel\n\nThen in my package.json, add something like this in my 'scripts':\n\"scripts\": {\n  .\n  .\n  \"tunnel\": \"( while true; do lt -p 3000 -s botmastersubdomain; done; )\",\n  .\n  .\n},\n\nI can then simply run the runnel as follows (most likely in another console tab):\nnpm run tunnel\n\nMany people also use ngrok instead of localtunnel. Although it is a paying service to get your own subdomain,\nyou can use it without paying and using a randomly allocated subdomain. Ngrok comes with a lot of goodies like a user interface\nwhere you can see exactly what requests came in etc.\n"},"messaging-platforms.html":{"url":"messaging-platforms.html","title":"Messaging Platforms","keywords":"","body":"Messaging Platforms\nBotmaster v3 is very minimal.

Installing them either via yarn add or via npm install --save\nAs it turns out, bot objects are really the ones running most of the show in the Botmaster framework (alongside middleware). Your botmaster object is simply a central point of control for you to manage all of your bots. Bot classes are built on top of the Botmaster BaseBot class that exposes all the actions one will want to take using Botmaster.\nBot objects allow you perform all sorts of actions. These actions go along the line of sending messages to users on the platform, getting info on a certain user (if platform supports that) and creating OutgoingMessages. See the api reference for BaseBot to see all the methods that can be used.\nAs much as you could just start shooting out messages right after creating a bot object (e.g. from our messengerBot object in the previous example), you'll typically be using bot objects within middleware. Without diving deep into middleware, we'll show how bot objects are used (similar to what we did in the quickstart)\nSend Messages\nLet's first note here, that you can have multiple bot objects for a certain type. I'm sure you can find reasons for why you would want to do this. This is important to mention, as you might have, say, 2 bots of type messenger dealt with via Botmaster. You might want to do platform specific code by doing the following:\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'some-middleware',\n  controller: (bot, update) => {\n    if (bot.type === 'messenger') {\n      // do messenger specific stuff like:\n      return bot.reply(update, 'you are using our bot on messenger');\n    })\n\n    return bot.reply(update, 'you are not using our bot on messenger');\n  }\n});\n\nThen you might want to do bot object specific code. You would do this as such:\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'some-middleware',\n  controller: (bot, update, next) => {\n    if (bot.type === 'messenger') {\n      // do messenger specific stuff\n      if (bot.id === 'YOUR_BOT_ID') {\n        // this will be e.g. the user id of your bot for messenger\n        // which is the newest of two bots that do similar stuff\n        return bot.reply(update, 'you are using the new version bot on messenger');\n      }\n      return bot.reply(update, 'you are using the old version bot on messenger');\n    })\n  }\n});\n\nOr if you declared your bots and botmaster as in the beginning of this section, you might have done the following:\nconst Botmaster = require('botmaster');\nconst MessengerBot = require('botmaster-messenger');\nconst SlackBot = require('botmaster-slack');\nconst TwitterDmBot = require('botmaster-twitter-dm');\n\nconst botmaster = new Botmaster();\n\n.\n. // full settings objects omitted for brevity\n.\nconst messengerBot1 = new MessengerBot(messengerSettings1);\nconst messengerBot2 = new MessengerBot(messengerSettings2);\nconst slackBot = new SlackBot(slackSettings);\nconst twitterBot = new TwitterBot(twitterSettings);\n\nbotmaster.addBot(messengerBot1);\nbotmaster.addBot(messengerBot2);\nbotmaster.addBot(slackBot);\nbotmaster.addBot(twitterBot);\n\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'some-middleware',\n  controller: (bot, update, next) => {\n    if (bot.type === 'messenger') {\n      // do messenger specific stuff\n      if (bot === messengerBot1) {\n        return bot.reply(update, 'you are using the new version bot on messenger');\n      }\n      return bot.reply(update, 'you are using the old version bot on messenger');\n    })\n  }\n});\n\n\nBotmaster does not assure you that the id parameter of the bot object will exist upon instantiation. the id is only assured to be there once an update has been received by the bot. I.e. in all middleware functions This is because some ids aren't known until botmaster knows 'who' the message was sent to (i.e. what id your bot should have).\n\nPerforming actions after a message is sent\nIt is also noteworthy that you would typically want to perform some action upon confirmation that the message was sent or catch a potential error. Because all the sendMessage helper functions return Promises, this is done as such:\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'some-name',\n  controller: (bot, update) => {\n    .\n    .\n    return bot.sendMessage(message)\n\n    .then((body) => {\n      console.log(body);\n    })\n\n    .catch((err) => {\n      console.log(err.message);\n    })\n  }\n})\n\nWhere the body object resolved from the sendMessage Promise will look As per the API reference, as such:\n {\n  sentOutgoingMessage: // the OutgoingMessage instance before being formatted\n  sentRawMessage: // the OutgoingMessage object after being formatted for the platforms\n  raw: rawBody, // the raw response from the platforms received from sending the message\n  recipient_id: ,\n  message_id: \n }\n\nIgnoring outgoing middleware all-together\nTypically, the sendMessage methods will hit all your setup outgoing middleware (read more about middleware here. If you want to avoid that and ignore your setup middleware in certain situations, do something like this:\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'some-name',\n  controller: (bot, update) => {\n    .\n    .\n    return bot.sendMessage(message, { ignoreMiddleware: true })\n  }\n})\n\nBot object parameters\nI'll note quickly that each bot object created comes from one of the various bot classes as seen above. They act in the same way on the surface (because of heavy standardization), but have a few idiosyncrasies here and there.\nMany of those idiosyncrasies can be found out by leveraging the following in your bot objects: bot.receives, bot.sends and bot.retrievesUserInfo. These objects look as such:\n1. bot.receives:\n    this.receives = {\n      text: false,\n      attachment: {\n        audio: false,\n        file: false,\n        image: false,\n        video: false,\n        location: false,\n        // can occur in FB messenger when user sends a message which only contains a URL\n        // most platforms won't support that\n        fallback: false,\n      },\n      echo: false,\n      read: false,\n      delivery: false,\n      postback: false,\n      // in FB Messenger, this will exist whenever a user clicks on\n      // a quick_reply button. It will contain the payload set by the developer\n      // when sending the outgoing message. Bot classes should only set this\n      // value to true if the platform they are building for has an equivalent\n      // to this.\n      quickReply: false,\n    };\n\n2. bot.sends:\n    this.sends = {\n      text: false,\n      quickReply: false,\n      locationQuickReply: false,\n      senderAction: {\n        typingOn: false,\n        typingOff: false,\n        markSeen: false,\n      },\n      attachment: {\n        audio: false,\n        file: false,\n        image: false,\n        video: false,\n      },\n    };\n\n3. bot.retrievesUserInfo:\nthis.retrievesUserInfo = false;\n\nWhere each of these values is true if the bot class implements them. All official bot classes will expose these elements to you so you can leverage those in your middleware.\nSome bot classes (like the one provided by the botmaster-messenger package) can expose methods that are only available for this specific bot type. These methods will always be prepended with an underscore. E.g. botmaster-messenger exposes: _setGetStartedButton which allow you to set up a get started button only in FB messenger.\nGetting bots\nAlso useful to note is that you can access all the bots added to botmaster by doing botmaster.bots. you can also use botmaster.getBot or botmaster.getBots to get a specific bot (using type or id);\nWriting your own bot class\nIt is important to take note of the addBot syntax as you can create your own Bot class that extends the Botmaster.BaseBot class. For instance, you might want to create your own class that supports your pre-existing messaging standards. Have a look at the writing your own bot class documentation to learn how to do this.\n"},"working-with-botmaster/middleware.html":{"url":"working-with-botmaster/middleware.html","title":"Middleware","keywords":"","body":"Middleware\nIf you've gone through the quickstart guide, you've actually already used middleware (well incoming middleware in this case).

They are all called in order of declaration upon receiving an update.\nBasic incoming middleware example\nHere is a very simple example of how one would go on and use incoming middleware:\n// middleware that uses next (standard middleware you might be acquainted with)\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'add-weather-to-update',\n  controller: (bot, update, next) => {\n    // assumed here that some weather API is queried to get that weatherInformation\n    update.weather = {\n      temperature: 23,\n      unit: 'celcius',\n    }\n    next(); // next needs to be called if your controller does not return a promise\n  }\n});\n\n// middleware that returns an explicit promise\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'add-user-info-to-update',\n  controller: (bot, update) => {\n    // update.weather will exist here\n    if (bot.retrievesUserInfo) {\n      return bot.getUserInfo(update.sender.id).then((userInfo) => {\n        update.userInfo = userInfo;\n      })\n    }\n\n    return Promise.resolve();\n  }\n});\n\n// middleware that uses async-await because we are using node7 with the async-await\n// harmony flag or a transpiler like Babel.\n\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'reply-to-user',\n  controller: async (bot, update) => {\n    let text;\n    if (update.weather.temperature > 17) {\n      text = 'the weather is warm';\n    } else {\n      text = 'the weather is cool';\n    }\n\n    if (update.userInfo) {\n      text += ` ${update.userInfo.first_name}`;\n    }\n\n    const body = await bot.reply(update, text);\n    // do stuff with the body object\n  }\n});\n\nThis is a very basic example. But hopefully, it gets the message through of how you can use incoming middleware. Here we see three ways to use middleware. All three are valid. I'll briefly address the three ways here:\n\nUsing next to go to the next middleware function declared in the stack. This is the most common way middleware functions have handed over control to the next middleware in the stack. Once your middleware function is entered, you do some things and then when you're ready, you call next(). It is handy to use middleware in this way whenever your middleware makes use of callback based apis or if it's synchronous in nature.\n\nReturning a Promise. Another way to hand over control to the next middleware function in the stack in Botmaster is to return a Promise. Whenever the promise resolves, control will be handed down to the next middleware function in the stack. In our example, we return the promise from getUserInfo if the bot class can retrieve user info. Otherwise, we return a promise that resolves straight away.\n\nReturning Promises is great. But it gets better when you start leveraging the use of async-await functions which are already supported in Node7+ (by using the --harmony-async-await flag). Or you can also use Babel or another transpiler to use them. Not how in this function we don't have to return anything at the end. This is because using async will wrap our function with a Promise that will resolve naturally when it runs its course. Also, using await anywhere within the function on any function that returns a promise will just pause until the promise resolves. That is what we do when we do: const body = await bot.reply(update, text);. The middleware won't go to the next one, because it is waiting for the reply function's promise to resolve. Using async-await with Botmaster middleware will soon be the preferred way to write middleware as it allows you to write synchronous looking code that just goes to the next middleware function whenever the function returns (or runs its course)\n\n\nBasic incoming middleware example with structure\nIn practice, your middleware code will really live within separate files that you would \"require\" within your main \"app.js\" file. That means that the previous example will have a tree structure similar to the following:\n├── app.js\n└── middleware\n    ├── incoming\n    │   ├── weather.js\n    │   ├── user_info.js\n    │   ├── reply.js\n    │   └── index.js\n    ├── outgoing // no outgoing middleware in this example\n    |    └── index.js // this will remain an empty file for now\n    └── wrapped // no wrapped middleware in this example\n        └── index.js // this will remain an empty file for now\nThis is only a suggested structure (the one I use). Feel free to come up with a different, potentially better, structure that suits you better.\nThat means that the previous example's code will probably look more like this:\nmiddleware/incoming/weather.js\nconst addWeatherToUpdate = {\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'add-weather-to-update',\n  controller: (bot, update, next) => {\n    // assumed here that some weather API is queried to get that weatherInformation\n    update.weather = {\n      temperature: 23,\n      unit: 'celcius',\n    }\n    next(); // next needs to be called if your controller does not return a promise\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  addWeatherToUpdate, // using shorthand here\n}\n\nmiddleware/incoming/user_info.js\nconst addUserInfoToUpdate = {\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'add-user-info-to-update',\n  controller: (bot, update) => {\n    // \"update.weather\" will exist here btw\n    if (bot.retrievesUserInfo) {\n      return bot.getUserInfo(update.sender.id).then((userInfo) => {\n        update.userInfo = userInfo;\n      })\n    }\n\n    return Promise.resolve();\n  }\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  addUserInfoToUpdate,\n}\n\nmiddleware/incoming/reply.js\nconst replyToUser = {\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'reply-to-user',\n  controller: async (bot, update) => {\n    let text;\n    if (update.weather.temperature > 17) {\n      text = 'the weather is warm';\n    } else {\n      text = 'the weather is cool';\n    }\n\n    if (update.userInfo) {\n      text += ` ${update.userInfo.first_name}`;\n    }\n\n    const body = await bot.reply(update, text);\n    // do stuff with the body object\n  }\n});\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  replyToUser, // using shorthand here\n}\n\nmiddleware/incoming/index.js\nconst weather = require('./weather');\nconst userInfo = require('./userInfo');\nconst reply = require('./reply');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  weather,\n  userInfo,\n  reply,\n};\n\napp.js\nconst incomingMiddleware = require('./middleware/incoming');\n\nbotmaster.use(incomingMiddleware.weather.addWeatherToUpdate);\nbotmaster.use(incomingMiddleware.userInfo.addUserInfoToUpdate);\nbotmaster.use(incomingMiddleware.reply.replyToUser);\n\nbotmaster.on('error', (bot, err) => {\n  console.log(err.message);\n})\n\nThis example is really the same as the first one.will be called only on bots of type messenger and the other one on all bots. We just separated it all in a reasonable file structure.\nIt should be clear by now that this reads much clearer than the previous example. Simply by reading the app.js file I can have an idea of what is going on in the code. Clearly, some weather information and user information is added to the update object. That information is then used to send customized reply to the user.\nDo note also that we have added an error event listener on the botmaster object. This is done because there is no other way for us to catch errors occurring in incoming middleware. So we emit them like that so you can deal with them in this event listener.\nNow that we've had a look at incoming middleware, let's have a look at how outgoing middleware works.\nOutgoing middleware\nsimilar to the incoming middleware, the outgoing middleware is called in order of declaration. However, it is called on every message object sent by you the developer. To illustrate this, here's an example:\nBasic example\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'reply-to-user',\n  controller: (bot, update) => {\n    return bot.reply(update, 'Hello world');\n  }\n});\n\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'outgoing',\n  name: 'change-text',\n  controller: (bot, update, message, next) => {\n    console.log(message); // this is a full valid messenger object/ OutgoingMessage object\n    message.message.text = \"Hello you!\";\n    next();\n  }\n});\n\n\nThe three types of middleware controller mentioned in incoming middleware are also valid with outgoing middleware. I.e. we could also have returned a Promise or does so using async-await functions.\n\nIn this example, the incoming middleware is what you would expect if you were simply trying to reply \"Hello world\" to any message. However, if you try this out, you'll see that you get a \"Hello you!\" text message back. Indeed, our middleware, aside from printing the message object to show you what it looks like, replaces the text with \"Hello you\".\nThis is really what you'll want to be doing within outgoing middleware. First use one of the Botmaster sendMessage helper functions to send a message, then edit it in your outgoing middleware functions. Botmaster simply creates the valid [messenger compatible] message object before hitting the outgoing middleware where you can play with this.\nBasic example with structure\nAs in the incoming middleware example, in practice, your middleware code will really live within separate files that you would \"require: within your main \"app.js\" file. Using a structure similar to the one used in the incoming middleware example. We look at something like this:\n├── app.js\n└── middleware\n    ├── incoming\n    │   ├── reply.js\n    │   └── index.js\n    └── outgoing\n        ├── message_transformers.js\n        └── index.js\nWhere the code for incoming middleware looks something like this as you could expect:\nmiddleware/incoming/reply.js\nconst replyToUser = {\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'reply-to-user',\n  controller: (bot, update) => {\n    return bot.reply(update, 'Hello world');\n  }\n});\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  replyToUser,\n}\n\nmiddleware/incoming/index.js\nconst reply = require('./reply');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  reply,\n};\n\nAnd the code for our outgoing middleware will look like this:\nmiddleware/outgoing/message_transformers.js\nconst changeText = {\n  type: 'outgoing',\n  name: 'change-text',\n  controller: (bot, update, message, next) => {\n    console.log(message); // this is a full valid messenger object/ OutgoingMessage object\n    message.message.text = \"Hello you!\";\n    next();\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  changeText,\n}\n\nmiddleware/outgoing/index.js\nconst messageTransformers = require('./message_transformers');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  messageTransformers,\n};\n\napp.js\nconst incomingMiddleware = require('./middleware/incoming');\nconst outgoingMiddleware = require('./middleware/outgoing');\n\nbotmaster.use(incomingMiddleware.reply.replyToUser);\n\nbotmaster.use(outgoingMiddleware.messageTransformers.changeText);\n\nThis might seem like slight overkill at this point because of how trivial of an example this is. But this adds clear structure to our project and when reading our app.js file we can already know what is going on. It also makes it very clear regarding what is going on if you were to add another middleware function right after the changeText one.\nComplete outgoing middleware example with structure\nWe first edit the reply we give to our user:\nmiddleware/incoming/reply.js\nconst replyToUser = {\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'reply-to-user',\n  controller: (bot, update) => {\n    return bot.sendTextCascadeTo(['Hi there, I`m about to ask you to press buttons:',\n      'Please press any of: [\"Button1\",\"Button2\"]',\n      'Thank you'], update.sender.id)\n    .catch((err) => {\n      console.log(err.message);\n    })\n  }\n});\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  replyToUser,\n}\n\nNote, we are here using the Bot classes sendTextCascadeTo helper function to send text messages one after the other. See Bot object.\nAlso note that we have a catch bit there ready to catch any error that might occur within our outgoing middleware or if the platform we are sending the messages to responds with an error/4xx statusCode.\nWe now update our outgoing middleware code:\nTaking this one step further, you can do something like the following to, say, send buttons without using the builtin sendDefaultButtonMessageTo method. We'll keep our structure and simply update the files to look like this:\nmiddleware/outgoing/message_transformers.js\nconst changeText = {\n  type: 'outgoing',\n  name: 'change-text',\n  controller: (bot, update, message, next) => {\n    if (message.message.text === 'Thank you') {\n      // yes, this is very arbitrary. But again, tries to drive the point of how middleware works\n      message.message.text = 'Thanks';\n    }\n    next();\n  }\n}\n\nconst addButtonsToMessage = {\n  type: 'outgoing',\n  name: 'add-buttons-to-message',\n  controller: (bot, update, message) => {\n    const text = message.message.text;\n\n    // will match anything that looks like this: `'[\"Button1\",\"Button2\"]'`\n    const buttonsRegexObject = text.match(/&\\[.+]/); \n    if (buttonsRegexObject) {\n      // extract buttonTitles into an array\n      const buttonTitles = JSON.parse(buttonsRegexObject[0].substring(1));\n      // remove them from the text\n      const message.message.text = text.replace(buttonsRegexObject[0], '');\n      // adds quick reply buttons to the OutgoingMessage object.\n      message.addPayloadLessQuickReplies(buttonTitles);\n    }\n\n    return Promise.resolve(); // could have used next here too. But driving the point that promises work too\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  changeText, // using shorthand here\n  addButtonsToMessage,\n}\n\nThis simple addButtonsToMessage middleware simply uses regular expressions to see if the text contains any bit of text that looks anything like the following: '[\"Button1\",\"Button2\"]'. If any such string is found, it then proceeds to remove said mentions from the text and then add a quick_replies component to your OutgoingMessage object. Note that it does so by using a helper method. These helper methods are available because Botmaster now wraps our message object in an outgoingMessage class that has helper functions to help with composing the message. See the OutgoingMessage write-up for more on that.\nWe next have a look at app.js that also has to be transformed:\napp.js\nconst incomingMiddleware = require('./middleware/incoming');\nconst outgoingMiddleware = require('./middleware/outgoing');\n\nbotmaster.use(incomingMiddleware.reply.replyToUser);\n\nbotmaster.use(outgoingMiddleware.messageTransformers.changeText);\nbotmaster.use(outgoingMiddleware.messageTransformers.addButtonsToMessage);\n\nNow this will work great. But actually, what i want to do is show the user a typing indicator right before sending every message that goes out. Because I'm using a sendCascade function, namely, sendTextCascadeTo, the best way to do so is to do this within an outgoing middleware function. Here's how we can edit app.js to achieve this goal:\napp.js\nconst incomingMiddleware = require('./middleware/incoming');\nconst outgoingMiddleware = require('./middleware/outgoing');\n\nbotmaster.use(incomingMiddleware.reply.replyToUser);\n\nbotmaster.use(outgoingMiddleware.messageTransformers.changeText);\nbotmaster.use(outgoingMiddleware.messageTransformers.addButtonsToMessage);\n\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'outgoing',\n  name: 'show-indicator-before-sending-message',\n  controller: (bot, update, message, next) => {\n    const userId = message.recipient.id;\n\n    bot.sendIsTypingMessageTo(userId, { ignoreMiddleware: true })\n\n    .then(() => {\n      setTimeout(() => {\n        next();\n      }, 1000);\n    };\n  },\n});\n\nThere's a few things going on in this added bit of code here. First we make it clear again that middleware code can technically live anywhere. It would be better to have it in a separate file somewhere. But this also works. Second, We introduce the ignoreMiddleware option when sending a message. This will always work and simply tells Botmaster to not go through any of the middleware with this message and send it directly. This is very important as otherwise, we would be stuck in an infinite loop trying to send an \"is typing\" indicator. Second we note that we use setTimeout to make it look like the bot is typing for about 1 second before firing out the message by calling next(). Note how we don't return the bot.sendIsTypingMessageTo promise here, if we did, the timeout wouldn't be respected and we would get an error, as next cannot be called when your middleware returns a promise.\nUsing skip and cancel\nMiddleware comes with a few options to skip the middleware after a certain one or all together cancel sending a message (in outgoing middleware). cancel does the same as skip in incoming middleware.\nHere's how you could use those.\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'first-middleware',\n  controller: (bot, update) => {\n    return useSomePromiseBasedFunction('something')\n    .then((valueFromFunction) => {\n      update.value = valueFromFunction;\n      return 'skip'; // the returned promise will resolve with 'skip'\n    })\n  }\n});\n\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'second-middleware',\n  controller: (bot, update, next) => {\n    // this will never get hit and nothing really will happen as `first middleware` does not send any message\n  }\n});\n\nskip can also be used by outgoing middleware along with cancel. Here is an example of using cancel:\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'incoming-middleware',\n  controller: (bot, update) => {\n    return bot.reply(update, 'Hey there');\n  }\n});\n\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'outgoing',\n  name: 'first-outgoing-middleware',\n  controller: (bot, update, message) => {\n    if (update.message.text === 'Hey there') { // for some arbitrary reason\n      return Promise.resolve('cancel');\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'outgoing',\n  name: 'second-outgoing-middleware',\n  controller: (bot, update, message) => {\n    // this will not get hit\n  }\n});\n\nIn this last example, not only will \"second outgoing middleware\" not get hit, the message will also not get sent out.\nPlease note, valid syntax for our \"first-outgoing-middleware are also the following two\"\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'outgoing',\n  name: 'first outgoing middleware',\n  controller: async (bot, update, message) => { // if using transpiler or node 7.x with harmony flag\n    if (update.message.text === 'Hey there') {\n      return 'cancel';\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nand\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'outgoing',\n  name: 'first outgoing middleware',\n  controller: (bot, update, message, next) => {\n    if (update.message.text === 'Hey there') {\n      next('cancel');\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nNow that we've covered almost all of middleware let's quickly introduce how all this middleware was added. We made extensive use of botmaster.use throughout this document and this is \nHere is the signature of botmaster.use\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmiddlewareObject\na valid middleware object.\n\n\n\nNow this might not be very helpful as what we really want to know is what this object looks like. It looks like this:\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntype\neither 'incoming' or 'outgoing' depending on what middleware you are setting up.\n\n\nname\n(optional) The name for this middleware. This is helpful in debugging, and you can expect it to be used in future versions of Botmaster. But it is optional. I strongly recommend naming your middleware.\n\n\ncontroller\nThe actual middleware function that will be called. It is of type: function(bot, update, next) on incoming and function(bot, update, message, next) on outgoing. The next parameter can be omitted if your controller returns a promise. Examples below ensue.\n\n\nincludeEcho\n(optional) Only valid for incoming middleware. Whether or not to run this middleware on echo updates. Defaults to false.\n\n\nincludeDelivery\n(optional) Only valid for incoming middleware. Whether or not to run this middleware on delivery updates. Defaults to false.\n\n\nincludeRead\n(optional) Only valid for incoming middleware. Whether or not to run this middleware user \"user read\" updates. Defaults to false.\n\n\n\nbotmaster.useWrapped\nThere is another way to declare middleware in botmaster as of v3. It is by using the useWrapped method. This method should be used after all your normal middleware has been setup using botmaster.use. Essentially, what it does is setup an incoming middleware at the very beginning of your incoming middleware stack and another one at the very end of your outgoing middleware stack.\nIts signature looks like this:\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nincomingMiddlewareObject\na valid incoming middleware object. (as described above)\n\n\noutgoingMiddlewareObject\na valid outgoing middleware object. (as described above)\n\n\n\nAnd it would be used as such:\nbotmaster.useWrapped(incomingMiddleware, outgoingMiddleware);\n\nWhere incomingMiddleware and outgoingMiddleware are valid middlewares of their respective types.\nThis is useful if writing a middleware package that want to be first to get the update object and last to see it when it goes out.\nIt is used in botmaster-session-ware for example.\nWhere is my middleware\nAlthough I doubt most would want to use this, it's good to know that middleware is accessible via all botmaster instances. Middleware stacks are exposed via botmaster.middleware.incomingMiddlewareStack and\nbotmaster.middleware.outgoingMiddlewareStack. Unless you really know what you are doing, it is best to leave those alone.\nExternal middleware\nThis is all great. But Using the code in addButtonsToMessage to add buttons to your message is probably not the best. Indeed, external middleware packages provide better solutions to this problem. To solve this particular problem, I would suggest having a look at fulfill. Like in any other framework that contains middleware, middleware can be put into packages. These packages are then available and downloadable via yarn or npm and thus easily accessible in your code. \nHave a look at the middlewares to see what official middleware is out there.\n"},"working-with-botmaster/incoming-update.html":{"url":"working-with-botmaster/incoming-update.html","title":"Incoming update","keywords":"","body":"Incoming update\nStandardization is at the heart of Botmaster. The framework was really created for that purpose. This means that updates coming from any platform have to have the same format.\nIn order to do that, the Facebook Messenger update/message format was chosen and adopted. This means that when your botmaster object receives an 'update' from anywhere, you can be sure that it will be of the same format as a similar message that would come from Facebook Messenger.\nTypically, it would look something like this for a message with an image attachment. Independent of what platform the message comes from:\n{\n  raw: ,\n  sender: {\n    id: \n  },\n  recipient: {\n    id:  // will typically be the bot's id\n  },\n  timestamp: ,\n  message: {\n    mid: ,\n    seq: ,\n    attachments: [\n      {\n        type: 'image',\n        payload: {\n          url: 'https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/.....'\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n};\n\nThis allows developers to handle these messages in one place only rather than doing it in multiple places. For more info on the various incoming messages formats, read the messenger bot doc on webhooks at: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhook-reference/message-received.\nTo know which kind of updates you'll get from the various platforms, have a look at the bot.receives values. See here. This will help you discriminate between which bot you receive what kind of updates from. And thus in turn where you want to send which messages.\n"},"working-with-botmaster/outgoing-message.html":{"url":"working-with-botmaster/outgoing-message.html","title":"Outgoing message","keywords":"","body":"Outgoing messages\nAs with incoming updates, in order to achieve standardization, Botmaster's OutgoingMessages  follow the Facebook Messenger update/message format.\nThis means that outgoing messages are expected to be formatted like messages the Messenger platform would expect.

For example:\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'my-incoming-middleware',\n  controller: (bot, update) => {\n    return reply(udpate, 'Hello there');\n  }\n});\n\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'outgoing',\n  name: 'my-outgoing-middleware',\n  controller: (bot, update, message) => {\n    // message will now be of type OutgoingMessage\n    console.log(message.constructor);\n  }\n})\n\nBecause the message object is of type OutgoingMessage, this means that all the helper functions to compose said object are now available to you. See what functions are made available in the API reference: here\nNow I realise you might not actually want to wait until you are inside of an outgoing middleware controller to have access to those OutgoingMessage helper functions. This is why you can create them from your bot object directly using the createOutgoingMessage helper methods that come with all bot instances. Again, checkout the api-reference for BaseBot to see how to use them.\n"},"working-with-botmaster/botmaster-object.html":{"url":"working-with-botmaster/botmaster-object.html","title":"Botmaster object","keywords":"","body":"Botmaster object\nSettings\nBotmaster can be started with a so-called botmasterSettings object. It has the following parameters:\nThe botmasterSettings object has the following parameters:\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nport\n(optional) The port to use for your webhooks (see webhooks to understand more about webhooks). This will only be used if the server parameter is not provided. Otherwise, it will be ignored.\n\n\nserver\n(optional) A valid node http server app object to mount the webhookEndpoints onto. If you choose to do this, it is assumed that you will be managing your own server instance (possibly via express of Koa or other). Thus, Botmaster won't start the server.\n\n\n\nUsing botsSettings would look something like this if you want to set the port:\nconst botmasterSettings = require('botmaster');\n\nconst botmasterSettings = {\n  // by default botmaster will start an express server that listens on port 3000\n  // you can pass in a port argument here to change this default setting:\n  port: 3001\n}\n\nconst botmaster = new Botmaster(botmasterSettings);\n\n.\n. // rest of code adding bots to botmaster etc\n.\n\n\nPlease note, unless you are passing in a server object to the settings, it is assumed that you don't want to deal with anything relating to an http server. That is, botmaster will create an express server under the hood and expose botmaster.server back.\n\nExample 1: Using Botmaster with your own express app\nHere's an example on how to do so if you are setting your credentials in your environment variables:\nconst Botmaster = require('botmaster');\nconst express = require('express');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst port = 3000;\nconst myServer = app.listen(port, '0.0.0.0');\nconst botmaster = new Botmaster({ server: myServer });\n\nmyServer.on('listening', () => {\n  console.log('My express app is listening and its server is used in Botmaster');\n})\n\nExample 2: Using Botmaster with your own Koa app\nHere's an example on how to do so if you are setting your credentials in your environment variables:\nconst Botmaster = require('botmaster');\nconst Koa = require('koa');\n\nconst app = new Koa();\nconst port = 3000;\nconst myServer = app.listen(port, '0.0.0.0');\nconst botmaster = new Botmaster({ server: myServer });\n\nmyServer.on('listening', () => {\n  console.log('My Koa app is listening and its server is used in Botmaster too');\n})\n\nEvents\nBotmaster is built on top of the EventEmitter node.js class. Which means it can emit events and most importantly for us here, it can listen onto them. By doing any of the following:\nbotmaster.on('listening', (message) => {\n  console.log(message);\n});\n\nbotmaster.on('error', (bot, err) => {\n  console.log(bot.type);\n  console.log(err.stack);\n});\n\nThese are the only two listeners that you can listen onto in botmaster. Let's go though them briefly:\nserver running\nThis event will be emitted only if you are not managing your own server (i.e. you started botmaster without setting the app parameter). It is just here to notify you that the server has been started. You don't necessarily need to use it. But you might want to do things at this point.\nerror\nThis event is thrown whenever an error internal to Botmaster occurs. I.e. if for some reason a mis-configured message was sent in. Or if some other kind of error occurred directly within Botmaster. It is good to listen onto this event and keep track of potential errors. Also, if you code an error within your incoming middleware, and don't catch it, it will be caught by Botmaster and emitted in to error. So like this you have full control of what is going on and can log everything straight from there.\n"},"working-with-botmaster/writing-your-own-bot-class.html":{"url":"working-with-botmaster/writing-your-own-bot-class.html","title":"Writing your own bot class","keywords":"","body":"Writing your own bot class\nBot classes\nThe following document assumes that you have read the main documentation in \"getting started\" and in \"working with botmaster\". A general understand of how Botmaster and more generally how chatbots work is also assumed.\nBecause of that, we will pick up right from there and start looking into the bot classes we built for \nbotmaster.\nA few of these bot classes are made available via the following packages:\nbotmaster-messenger, botmaster-slack, botmaster-socket.io, botmaster-telegram, botmaster-twitter-dm.\nLet's say you added botmaster-messenger as a dependency to your project. You'll then be able to do the following:\nconst Botmaster = require('botmaster');\nconst MessengerBot = require('botmaster-messenger');\n\nconst messengerSettings = {\n  credentials: {\n    verifyToken: 'YOUR verifyToken',\n    pageToken: 'YOUR pageToken',\n    fbAppSecret: 'YOUR fbAppSecret'\n  },\n  webhookEndpoint: 'webhook1234',\n};\n\nconst messengerBot = new MessengerBot(messengerSettings);\n\nIn order to get updates from Messenger, you would then be expected to mount your bot's requestListener messengerBot.requestListener onto your own server by doing something like this:\nserver = require('http');\nserver.createServer(messenger.requestListener);\nserver.listen(3001, '0.0.0.0');\n\nNow if requests come into your server (on any endpoint), your messengerBot object will try to \"emit\" the update, i.e. run its master's incoming middleware with it. But you guessed correctly if you thought that this would not work. Because messengerBot has been added to no botmaster instance, we will get the following error: 'bot needs to be added to a botmaster instance in order to emit received updates'.\nLet's make it work then:\nMaking Botmaster objects and bot objects work together\nDoing this is really trivial and as it turns out, you do this every time you use the addBot method.\nWe recall from the various guides that to create a botmaster object the following is needed:\nconst Botmaster = require('botmaster');\nconst botmaster = new Botmaster({\n  server, // the server object we created earlier\n});\n\nAs usual, we create a botmaster object. And we make sure that it uses the same server as the one we defined earlier. We then add the messengerBot as follows:\nbotmaster.addBot(messengerBot);\n\nThis will mount your bot onto: https://Your_Domain_Name:3001/messenger/webhook1234. Note how the bot type is part of the endpoint although it is not part of the endpoint. This is because the Botmaster class assumes that you want your endpoint to be mounted onto its botType.\nNow when our server receives updates to https://Your_Domain_Name:3001/messenger/webhook1234, it will forward it to our incoming middleware. It is important to note that this line: server.createServer(messenger.requestListener); will not pose any problem, as botmaster strips all requestlisteners from the server object when instantiated and calls them only if none of the added bot endpoints get hit.\nThe main takeaway from all this is that if you are writing a bot class that uses webhooks, all that needs to be exposed is a valid bot.requestListener function. We'll see how to do this with express and Koa further down.\nCreating your own bot classes\nBefore defining the rules that have to be respected in order to write a Botmaster compatible bot class let's look at the constructor of one of the existing ones. The one from botmaster-telegram in this case:\n#constructor(settings)\nclass TelegramBot extends BaseBot {\n\n  constructor(settings) {\n    super(settings);\n    this.type = 'telegram';\n    this.requiresWebhook = true;\n    this.requiredCredentials = ['authToken'];\n\n    this.receives = {\n      text: true,\n      attachment: {\n        audio: true,\n        file: true,\n        image: true,\n        video: true,\n        location: true,\n        fallback: false,\n      },\n      echo: false,\n      read: false,\n      delivery: false,\n      postback: false,\n      quickReply: false,\n    };\n\n    this.sends = {\n      text: true,\n      quickReply: true,\n      locationQuickReply: false,\n      senderAction: {\n        typingOn: true,\n        typingOff: false,\n        markSeen: false,\n      },\n      attachment: {\n        audio: true,\n        file: true,\n        image: true,\n        video: true,\n      },\n    };\n\n    this.retrievesUserInfo = false;\n\n    .\n    .\n    this.id = this.credentials.authToken.split(':')[0];\n\n    this.__applySettings(settings);\n    this.__createMountPoints();\n  }\n\n }\n\nLet's look into this line by line (or almost). The first line reads super(settings). Which of course just means it calls the constructor of TelegramBot's superclass, namely, BaseBot. BaseBot's constructor doesn't actually do anything fancy a part from calling its own superclass's constructor and setting a few default values [as pointers for you, the developer]. BaseBot calls its own superclass's constructor as it inherits from node.js's EventEmitter which will allow your bot's classes to listen to events as well as emit them.\nThe following three lines setup some important values.\n\nthis.type: the type of bot that is being instantiated. It's important to specify that as developers might want to condition some code on the type of bot you are writing.\nthis.requiresWebhook: whether the bot requires webhooks. If the platform you are coding for requires webhooks, you will be expected to set a this.app variable at some point in the setup. We'll look into this when we have a look at what the this.__createMountPoints(); does.\nthis.requiredCredentials: sets up an array of credentials that are expected to be defined for the platform you are coding your class for. Telegram only takes in 1, so we just have an array with the value 'authToken'.\nthis.receives An object describing what kind of updates this bot class can receive. I.e. If a platforms supports a certain type, only set a value to true if updates are converted to the FB messenger type for that update type too.\nthis.sends Quite like this.receives, just describes what messages can be sent from this bot.\nthis.retrievesUserInfo set to true if the platform/bot class can provide extended information on a user by using the bot.getUserInfo method.\nthis.id the id that is proper to the bot. If not set at this point, it should be set upon receiving the first update from the platform\n\n#__applySettings(settings)\nThe next line calls the this.__applySettings(settings) function. This function is implemented in BaseBot and will just make sure that the settings passed on to the bot constructor are valid with respect to the parameters you defined. You should always call this function directly after setting the three [or more or less depending on your bot] parameters specific to the platform you are coding for. If valid, the settings will then be applied to the bot object. e.g. this.webhookEndpoint will be set to settings.webhookEndpoint.\nReceiving Updates\n#__createMountPoints()\nThe last line of our controller makes a call to this.__createMountPoints();. This line should only be present if your bot class requires webhooks. If this is the case, you will be expected to define a class member function that looks something like:\n__createMountPoints() {\n  this.app = express();\n  this.requestListener = this.app;\n  // for parsing application/json\n  this.app.use(bodyParser.json());\n  // for parsing application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n  this.app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));\n\n  this.app.post('*', (req, res) => {\n    this.__formatUpdate(req.body)\n\n    .then((update) => {\n      this.__emitUpdate(update);\n    }, (err) => {\n      err.message = `Error in __formatUpdate \"${err.message}\". Please report this.`;\n      this.emit('error', err);\n    });\n\n    // just letting telegram know we got the update\n    res.sendStatus(200);\n  });\n}\n\nIf we were using Koa in our Bot class, this function would look like this:\n__createMountPoints() {\n  this.app = new Koa();\n  this.requestListener = this.app.callback();\n\n  app.use((ctx) => {\n    let bodyString = '';\n    ctx.req.on('data', (chunk) => {\n      bodyString += chunk;\n    });\n\n    ctx.req.on('end', async () => {\n      const body = JSON.parse(bodyString);\n      try {\n        const update = await this.__formatUpdate(req.body)\n        this.__emitUpdate(update);\n      } catch (err) {\n        err.message = `Error in __formatUpdate \"${err.message}\". Please report this.`;\n        this.emit('error', err);\n      }\n    });\n\n    ctx.status = 200;\n  });\n}\n\nNote how in our express app, we are accepting requests from every route. That's because the botmaster object is responsible to making sure that only requests that are destined for this bot will actually end up hitting that function.\nVery importantly, both these functions create a valid this.requestListener that will be mounted onto the botmaster.server whenever botmaster.addBot is used.\nrequestListeners\nValid requestListeners are simply functions that could be used when using node http's createServer or listen functions. I.e. in Node, in general, you could do \nconst app = new Koa();\nconst someServer = http.createServer(app.callback());\nsomeServer.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0');\n\nwhich would be equivalent to:\nconst app = new Koa();\nconst someServer = http.createServer();\nsomeServer.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0', app.callback());\n\nor\nconst app = new Koa();\nconst someServer = app.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0');\n\nThis is equivalent to doing the same thing with express, using the app object. So here's an example\nconst app = express();\nconst someServer = http.createServer(app);\nsomeServer.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0');\n\nAs the app object in express is a valid requestListener.\nNot using webhooks?\nYou might have another function that needs to be called at this point. For instance, in the socketioBot class, I make a call to: this.__setupSocketioServer(); and that function looks like this:\n__setupSocketioServer() {\n  this.ioServer = io(this.server);\n\n  this.ioServer.on('connection', (socket) => {\n    debug(`new socket connected with id: ${socket.id}`);\n    socket.join(SocketioBot.__getBotmasteruserId(socket));\n\n    socket.on('message', (message) => {\n      // just broadcast the message to other connected clients with same user id\n      const botmasterUserId = SocketioBot.__getBotmasteruserId(socket);\n      socket.broadcast.to(botmasterUserId).emit('own message', message);\n      const rawUpdate = message;\n      try {\n        rawUpdate.socket = socket;\n      } catch (err) {\n        err.message = `Expected JSON object but got '${typeof message}' ${message} instead`;\n        return this.emit('error', err);\n      }\n      const update = this.__formatUpdate(rawUpdate, botmasterUserId);\n      return this.__emitUpdate(update);\n    });\n  });\n}\n\nFeel free to have a thorough read at this to understand what is going on here. Because it isn't necessary to understand this in order to build your own bot class, I won't explain what is going on here.\n#__formatUpdate(rawUpdate)\nAlthough you can technically handle the body of the request as you wish. In our __createMountPoints example here (from TelegramBot code), we make a call to the __formatUpdate function with the body of the request.\nIt would make sense for you to do so for consistency and because it has to be defined if you want your bot class to eventually be referenced in the Botmaster project.\nThis function is expected to transform the rawUpdate into an object which is of the format of Messenger updates, while having an update.raw bit that references that rawUpdate received.\nTypically, it would look something like this for a message with an image attachment. Independent of what platform the message comes from:\n{\n  raw: ,\n  sender: {\n    id: \n  },\n  recipient: {\n    id:  // will typically be the bot's id\n  },\n  timestamp: ,\n  message: {\n    mid: ,\n    seq: ,\n    attachments: [\n      {\n        type: 'image',\n        payload: {\n          url: 'SOME_IMAGE_URL'\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n};\nYour function should return the update object(or a promise that resolves a formatted update object) in order to then call __emitUpdate with it as a parameter.\n#__emitUpdate(update)\nLike __applySettings, this method is implemented in BaseBot. It handles errorsa and most importantly calling the incoming middleware stack. You can overwrite this method if you wish, but in its current state, it handles the most important cases you will want to deal with. You should call this method with the formatted update object created by calling formatUpdate();\nSending messages\nWhenever a message is being sent (i.e. a sendMessage helper function is being used), the following methods of your bot class will get hit in order:\n\n__formatOutgoingMessage\n__sendMessage\n__createStandardBodyResponseComponents\n\n#__formatOutgoingMessage(message)\nFirst, just like for receiving updates, we need to format outgoing messages to the format that will be accepted by the platform we are sending a message to.\nThis function takes in a valid OutgoingMessage as only parameter and returns a formattedOutgoingMessage or RawOutgoingMessage, or a Promise that resolves with that value.\n#__sendMessage(rawMessage)\nThe __sendMessage is called right after your formatOutgoingMessage method and will be passed the formattedOutgoingMessage/rawMessage that was returned by formatOutgoingMessage.\n Code for it might look like this simplified one from TelegramBot:\n__sendMessage(rawMessage) {\n  const endPoint = rawMessage.action\n  ? 'sendChatAction'\n  : 'sendMessage';\n\n  // this.baseUrl is: 'https://api.telegram.org',\n  const url = `${this.baseUrl}/${endPoint}`;\n\n  const options = {\n    url,\n    method: 'POST',\n    json: rawMessage,\n  };\n\n  return request(options);\n}\n\nThis method then has to return a promise that resolves with the body response from the platform.\n#__createStandardBodyResponseComponents\nLastly, before resolving the promise that first called the sendMessage helper function, we want to make sure we can provide them with some sort of standardized components in the body. So this method should return an object that looks like this:\nThis means we will need to \n  {\n   recipient_id: ,\n   message_id: \n  }\n\n In order to do that, this method gets called like such:\n __createStandardBodyResponseComponents(sentOutgoingMessage, sentRawMessage, rawBody)\nI.e. everything that has to do with the sent message is available to you.\nBaseBot sendMessage helper functions\nPlease note that the BaseBot superclass defines a set of methods that allow developers to more easily send messages to all platforms without having to build the whole Messenger compatible object themselves. These methods are the following:\nsendMessage\nsendMessageTo\nsendTextMessageTo\nreply\nsendAttachmentTo\nsendAttachmentFromURLTo\nsendDefaultButtonMessageTo\nsendIsTypingMessageTo\nsendCascadeTo\nsendTextCascadeTo\nAll these methods will convert a developer specified input into a Facebook Messenger compatible message that will be called as a parameter to __sendMessage. That is, they all eventually will call your __sendMessage method. You can however overwrite them if need be.\n#__setBotIdIfNotSet(update)\nIn order to help you identify between bots of different types, you will want each bot instance to have a this.id value. This should typically be the same as update.recipient.id when getting updates. If these aren't set upon instantiation (as with Facebook Messenger bots), you can write a function like this botamaster-messenger one that gets called upon receiving a message.\n__setBotIdIfNotSet(update) {\n  if (!this.id) {\n      this.id = update.recipient.id;\n  }\n}\n\nExtending bot classes\nAs you might expect, you can extend any bot class that exists, not just BaseBot for your own purpose. You can also expose any added method by prepending them with a single underscore (which tells developers this function is only available for this botType and not via BaseBot)\n"},"middlewares/":{"url":"middlewares/","title":"Middlewares","keywords":"","body":"Middleware\nMiddleware extends botmaster with additional functionality.

It is a great way to separate business logic (when to do what and where) and functional logic (how to do it).\nWhen writing the output of your bots all you have to do is write:\n\"ok , im placing your order for you.  here you go. \"\n\nHere userName could for example mean get a human readable version of the audience's name.\nplaceOrder  does two much more interesting things and demonstrates the power of using markup over a simple field-based JSON payload. First, it sends the rest of the message before the tag (\"ok bob, I'm placing your order for you.\") onwards so that the user knows we are placing his order. Second, it starts placing the order and when its done, it sends the text following it, \"here you go.\"\nAnd in order to connect that all you have to do is write in plain js:\nconst actions = {\n    // for \n    userName: {\n        controller: function(params) {\n            // return a promise (using an imaginary getUser method)\n            return getUser(params.context.user)\n                .then( function(result) {\n                    return result.user.name\n                    // if name is \"bob\" then the text would be\n                    // \"ok bob, I'm placing your oder for you.\"\n                });\n        }\n    },\n    // for \n    placeOrder: {\n        // replace not just the tag, but the text after too\n        replace: 'after',\n        controller: function(params) {\n            placeOrder(params.context.order)\n                .then( function(result) {\n                    // once the order is placed then send the rest of the message\n                    params.sendMessage(params.after)\n                });\n            // remove the tag and the text after it and send the message (\"ok bob, I'm placing your order for you.\")\n            return '';\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe most ipmortant part of the action spec is what the controller function returns. The return value If you want to strip it out\nHow to use the Fulfill API\nYou use fulfill by specifying an action spec. At a minimum your spec must specify controller as a javascript function that can return either by callback, promise or even synchronously. The action controller receives a params object which it can use as parameters such as the contents of the tag or data about the chat, which is stored in a variable called context. It can update the context and its return value will replace the tag. If the returned value from an action includes another action, this action will also be evaluated.\nOnce fulfill has finished evaluating or actions you get back an updated response string and any context passed in has been modified in place.\nFormat for the action spec\nYou should provide an actions object where the key is the name of the xml element that will be matched. The value should specify another object that has the key controller which as a value should have a function that takes params and an optional callback.\nconst actions = {\n// sync  example\n  burgerImage: {\n    controller: function() {\n      return \"\";\n    }\n  },\n// error first callback Stuff to order\n  modifyOrder: {\n    controller: function(params, cb) {\n      myOrderAPI.modify(params.context.orderId, params.content, params.attributes.style, function(err) {\n        if (! err) {\n          cb(null, \"There, consider yourself tomatoed!\");\n        } else {\n          cb(null, \"Sorry I can't modify your order now. Please check again later\")\n        }\n        });\n    }\n  },\n// promise example\n  hi: {\n    controller: function(params) {\n        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n          resolve(\"hello world\");\n        });\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nMore info on params:\nParams argument provides several variables that can control its behavior.\n\nparams.context: a reference to the context object which can be updated or read\nparams.content: the literal text between the xml element opening and closing\nparams.attributes: an object where keys are the name of an attribute against the xml element and the the value is the value of that attribute.\nparams.after: all text and tags before the tag.\nparams.before: all text and tags preceding the tag.\n\nContext:\ncontext provides a great deal of control and allows you to pass custom dependencies down to your controllers.\nIt should not be confused with the context variable that your NLU like IBM Conversations uses.\nFor example:\nconst context = {\n    myEnvironment: {\n        username, password\n    }\n    myApis: {\n        dbLibrary\n    }\n}\n\nbotmaster.use('outgoing', outgoing({actions, context}))\n\nFulfill will merge these custom context with several standard context objects available when using as part of botmaster.\nStandard Context\n\n\n\nKey\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nparams.update\nBotmaster update object\n\n\nparams.bot\nBotmaster bot object\n\n\n\n\nTo get an NLU's context the update handler or one of the middleware's should have set it in update. So for example your context might be in context.update.context.\n\nGetting impatient - emitting updates before fulfill has completed\nYou might want to cascade messages and separate them by one minute pauses. Or you want to let your user know that you are working on it. Whatever your use case, emitting multiple updates is not a problem. In botmaster you will also have available context.bot.sendMessage which you can use to send another template response down the pipeline. This will be processed again by fulfill since fulfill is part of the outgoing middleware stack. This is actually advantageous because this way you can be sure that there are no further actions to fulfill from the emitted message.\nIf you are not using botmaster you can achieve the same thing by including in the context an emitter which should set off a handler that calls fulfill.\nAdditional controller configuration options\nBy default, an action modifies the response text by replacing the xml tag with its response inline. This allows multiple actions in a response to not conflict. Note that this default does not allow you to modify any text surrounding the tag.\nTake the following example:\n hi how are  today?\n\nWith the default mode you can only replace the tag. There are however other modes available that allow you to modify surrounding text.\naction.replace:\n\n= 'before' Replace the tag and text before the tag until another tag is reached. In the example above setting you to this mode will have the controller control up to hi how are .\n= after Replace the tag and text after the tag until another tag is reached. In the example above setting after to this mode will set the controller to control  hi how are you.\n= adjacent Replace the tag and text before and after the tag until other tags are reached. In the example above setting you to this mode will set the controller to control hi how are  today ?.\n\nUsing botmaster-fulfill\nBotmaster-fulfill exports two functions. The first is fulfill and implements the fulfill API. The second FulfillWare produces botmaster outgoing middleware.\nIf you look at the quick start example the necessary steps are:\n\nrequire the necessary dependencies (the examples gets the outgoing function through destructuring)\nconnect our bots to botmaster\nget actions pass as settings object to outgoing function for it to generate our middleware.\nregister the resulting middleware to botmaster outgoing middlware.\n\nAdditional middleware options\nAll of these settings are optional and have reasonable defaults.\n\nsettings.context By default {bot, update} is passed as the context object which is made available to actions. If you want any other variables available in the context assign them as values in the settings.object. bot and update will still be passed into the fulfill context and will overwrite any bot or update in your custom context.\nsettings.updateToInput By default update.message.text is used as the input into response. If this is not acceptable you can define your own function. It will receive an object {bot, update} and expect a string response.\nsettings.responseToUpdate By default update.message.text is replaced with the response from fulfill. It also returns true for sending an update when the response is not empty (''). To define your own setter define a function that accepts update and response, modifies the update in place, and returns true or false whether that update should be sent.\n\nUsing standalone without botmaster\nconst {fulfill} = require('botmaster-fulfill');\n// the input and context would be from your chatbot, but assume they look like this.\n// also assume actions above\nvar input = \"\";\nvar context = {};\nfulfill(actions, context, input, function(err, response)  {\n    // response =  'hello world!'\n})\n\nSetup hint - drag and drop action modules\nYou can drag and drop actions by requiring from an actions folder where you setup your middleware:\nconst actions = require('./actions');\n\nIn your your actions directory then need to include an index.js:\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nfs.readdirSync(__dirname).forEach(function (file) {\n    if (file.endsWith(\".js\") && file !== \"index.js\")\n        exports[file.substr(0, file.length - 3)] = require(\"./\" + file);\n});\n\nEach action module should export an object that specifies a controller.\nDebug\nYou can enable debug mode by setting DEBUG = botmaster:fulfill:* in your environment.\n"},"tutorials/":{"url":"tutorials/","title":"Tutorials","keywords":"","body":"Tutorials\nFulfill\nWatson Conversation\n"},"tutorials/using-fulfill.html":{"url":"tutorials/using-fulfill.html","title":"Using Fulfill","keywords":"","body":"\nThis documentation is valid for botmaster 2.x.x This guide will be update once a version of botmaster-fulfill for botmaster 3.x.x is published\n\nUsing Botmaster Fulfill middleware\nAlthough many of you will be using Botmaster because of its ability to connect with message sources like Facebook Messenger, it also has a powerful middleware called Botmaster Fulfill. Fulfill helps helps greatly with building more sophisticated bots that need integrations with external data sources and more complex logic. It's task is to provide a framework for addressing tasks that are outside of the scope of a core NLU or AI engine, so it's complementary to something like Watson Conversation or Wit.ai.\nWhat can I do with Botmaster Fulfill?\nYou hopefully want to wow your bot's users with some high-end functionality that gets them hooked on using a conversational interface to get stuff done. If so, you will need to rely on more than pre-canned static replies held within your AI engine – such bots can get pretty boring quite quickly.\nConnecting your bot to more dynamic and real-time sources of information is probably high on your priority list. In addition, taking advantage of UI features like buttons and location awareness, might also be things you are interested in. These are the kind of things that Botmaster Fulfill can help with.\nTo get specific, here is a set of things that you might use Botmaster Fulfill for:\n\nSpecifying where various types of buttons might be used within the conversation to guide the user's response.\nSpecifying how a longer conversational response should be broken into a series of shorter messages that appear one-after-the-other in the user's messaging app, just like we tend to do when texting a friend.\nCalling external API services and integrating the results into the conversation, for example adding a stock quote or weather forecast. Or a call to your organisation's core systems to retrieve a customer order or balance.\nInitiating transactions such as placing an order or making a payment.\nMaking a time-of-day specific greetings (Good morning, Good afternoon, Good evening, etc).\n\nIn short, anything you need your bot to do that your AI doesn't, is probably a candidate for Botmast Fulfill.\nWhy should I use Botmaster Fulfill?\n\"Separation of concerns\" is generally considered a good thing. It turns out that in bot design, it's an especially good thing. Why do we say that?\nDesigning your conversational flow and how your bot responds to questions is an analyst-type job - you need people good at understanding the problem domain and how to craft a great conversations. You these people to have a nice life, unencumbered by any technical complexities.\nIf your bot needs to invoke programming logic, for example to call an external API and include the results into the bot's response, you surely want to keep that programming away from your conversational analysts.\nHowever, before Botmaster Fulfill it was tricky to keep your conversational design totally separate from your integration logic. Or sometimes you ended up with small pieces of logic buried in your conversational flow who flagged things to some external integration logic - which is basically unmaintainable in the long term.\nBotmaster Fulfill solves these problems by providing a clean separation of concerns. With it, conversational analysts use simple XML tags to markup a bot's responses. Those tags are interpreted by a series of javascript modules that implement the logic needed. The conversational analyst gets to specify when logic should be called and the engineer gets to separately specify how that logic is implemented....and we achieve a separation of concerns.\nHow do I use Fulfill in my conversational flow?\nThe beauty of Botmaster Fulfill is that complex logic can be specified by including very simple XML tags within a bot's response text. For example, in the following dialog response the\n tag is identified by Botmaster Fulfill and replaced with the result of an API call to a weather forecast service.\nI thought you might like a weather forecaset, so here it is: \n\nWhat is super nice here, is that your dialog designer doesn't need to worry about how the weather API works or indeed how to get the result of that API call into her conversational response. That's the engineer's job - which we will come to shortly.\nHere's another, more complex, example:\nHow are you today?Good,Bad,Indifferent\nThis results in two separate messages being sent:\n\nA message that's reflective of the time of day, such as \"Good morning!\" or \"Good afternoon.\"\nA second message \"How are you today?\" with three quick-reply buttons Good, Bad, Indifferent.\n\nAs you can hopefully see, multiple XML tags can be included within the same response, building some quite sophisticated responses and integrations. It's super-simple for the conversational analyst to specify these tags and the programming logic to implement them is totally separated.\nSounds great, how do I get started?\nThe implementation of the logic needed to fulfill these XML tags is through what we call a Botmaster Fulfill action. These actions are really just standard javascript code, so any half-decent node coder should be able to get to grips with things pretty quickly.\nBut to get us going, we're first going to use some pre-defined Botmaster Fulfill actions. We'll move on to making our own custom actions in the next step.\nFirst of all install Botmaster Fulfill using: npm install botmaster-fulfill -S\nThen, install the pre-defined Botmaster Fulfill actions using: npm install botmaster-fulfill-actions -S\nNow add the following code to your Botmaster app.js file:\nconst {fulfillOutgoingWare} = require('botmaster-fulfill');\nconst actions = require('botmaster-fulfill-actions');\nbotmaster.use('outgoing', fulfillOutgoingWare({\n  actions\n}));\n\nNow we're ready to go! At the time of writing, the standard actions include:\n\n - which breaks the message into two separate messages, one from each side of the pause tag.\n - which returns a location/language relevant greeting such as \"Good morning\" or \"Good evening\", depending on the time of day and the timezone/location specified.\n\nGo ahead and try these out by adding something like the following as a response in whatever dialoging engine you are using: How are you today?\nIf you haven't wired up an AI engine yet, you could just add the following code to your app.js file. If you do that, it doesn't matter what you type into your bot, you'll get the same answer - but it does the job of exercising Botmaster Fulfill and its standard actions.\nbotmaster.on('update', (bot, update) => {\n  bot.reply(update, 'How are you today?');\n});\n\nHow cool is that?! The Botmaster project is hoping to expand this set of standard actions, so keep an eye on the Github repo.\nBut how do I write my own Botmaster Fulfill actions?\nAs we discussed earlier, Botmaster Fulfill actions are just javascript – so, as you're already using Botmaster, you will already be at least vaguely competent at this task. It's OK if you're still at the vague end of the competency spectrum - you can write simple Actions with very basic knowledge.\nLets start off by modifying our above code with a super-simple custom action. To do this, we define our custom action by adding the following code after the definition of standardActions in the app.js we used in the last step.\nconst checkUserState = {\n  controller: function(params) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n      resolve('How are you today?');\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nThis is pretty self-explanatory – checkUserState is the name of the XML tag this code implements. The variable params is just a placeholder for whatever text might be between the open and closing XML tags. In our case this will be empty, because we have a single open/close tag. We return a Javascript Promise that resoles to \"How are you today?\", the text that replaces our checkUserState tag in the bot's reply. Returning a Promise means our code is executed asynchronously - which is pretty handy if you're calling an external API, for example.\nNext, we need to modify our botmaster.use statement to include checkUserState as follows:\nactions.checkUserState = checkUserState;\nbotmaster.use('outgoing', fulfillOutgoingWare({\n  actions\n}));\n\nAnd change our bot reply text to something like the following: \nNow this might not be the best of example - it's a bit overkill to implement a simple question as a Fulfill Action. However, it's often good to start with something basic so as not to overwhelm ourselves. And \"Hello World\" has become a bit too ubiquitous for my liking.\nUsing Fulfill to create Quick Reply Buttons\nAs we've asked a question at this point, wouldn't it be kind of cool if we provided a Yes and No Quick Reply button as a response? Luckily this is pretty easy to do with Botmaster's Quick Reply functionality in partnership with Botmaster Fulfill.\nTo do this we can add the following Botmaster Fulfill action for buttons:\nbuttons: {\n  controller: (params) => {\n     const buttonTitles = params.content.split('|');\n     params.update.message.quick_replies = [];\n     for (const buttonTitle of buttonTitles) {\n       params.update.message.quick_replies.push({\n         content_type: 'text',\n         title: buttonTitle,\n         payload: buttonTitle,\n       });\n     }\n     return '';\n  }\n}\n\nAnd update our reply to be: Yes|No\nDo you see what we're doing here? The button titles are included between the opening/closing\n tags and separated by “|“. Our controller receives this in the paramas object and splits its contents apart to create a Botmaster quick replies array. You can hopefully see how you might use the same principle to create other types of Botmaster reply objects.\n\nFinding the user's location\nIf the user is using Facebook Messenger, we can extend the above example to generate a special button asking for the user's location, which results in us receiving the user's latitude/longitude.\nlocButton: {\n  controller: (params) => {\n     params.update.message.quick_replies = [];\n     params.update.message.quick_replies.push({\n      content_type: 'location',\n     });\n     return '';\n   }\n}\n\nand change the returned text to:\nbotmaster.on('update', (bot, update) => {\n  if (update.message.text != ('Good' || 'Bad' || 'Indifferent')) {\n    bot.reply(update, ' How are you today?Good,Bad,Indifferent');\n  } else {\n    bot.reply(update, 'OK. It would be interesting to know where you are.');\n  }\n});\n\nSo now we have a message returned to us that has the user's location embedded within in it. How about we use that latitude/longitude to get a weather forecast using a Fulfill action and return that to the user?\nCalling an external API in a Fulfill Action\nSo far our examples have been quite trivial. But Fulfill can do some pretty sophisticated things. One thing we find particularly useful is the ability to call an external API and integrate it's results into the conversational response.\nFor this exercise we're going to integrate the results of a weather forecast API call into our bot's response.\nHere's the function that calls the weather API service. You'll need to register here in Bluemix and provide the required userID and password fields to make it work.\nfunction getWeather(params) {\n  const lat = params.content.split(',')[0];\n  const long = params.content.split(',')[1];\n  const requestOptions = {\n    url: 'https://twcservice.mybluemix.net/api/weather/v1/geocode/' + lat + '/' + long + '/forecast/daily/3day.json?language=en-US&units=e',\n    auth: {\n      user: '[enter user-id here]',\n      pass: '[enter password here]',\n      sendImmediately: true\n    },\n    json: true\n  };\n  return request(requestOptions)\n    .then((body) => body.forecasts[0].narrative);\n}\n\nAnd here's our weather Action definition:\nweather: {\n  controller: function(params) {\n     return getWeather(params)\n       .then(function(result) {\n          console.log(result);\n          return 'I thought you might like a weather forecast for that location.' + result;\n        })\n       .catch(function(err) {\n         console.log(err);\n         return 'Sorry, no weather forecast available at the moment.';\n       });\n  }\n}\n\nIf we update our bot message return logic to the following, we should be able to get a weather forecast sent back to the user when they click on one of the Good, Bad, Indifferent buttons:\nbotmaster.on('update', (bot, update) => {\n  if (typeof update.message.attachments != 'undefined') {\n    if (update.message.attachments[0].type == 'location') {\n      const lat = update.message.attachments[0].payload.coordinates.lat;\n      const long = update.message.attachments[0].payload.coordinates.long;\n      bot.reply(update, '' + lat + ',' + long + '');\n    }\n  } else {\n    if (update.message.text != ('Good' || 'Bad' || 'Indifferent')) {\n      bot.reply(update, ' How are you today?Good,Bad,Indifferent');\n    } else {\n      bot.reply(update, 'OK. It would be interesting to know where you are.');\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nSo there you have it. Using Botmaster Fulfill to execute standard actions that generate a greeting and break messages up. Using Botmaster Fulfill to generate quick reply buttons, get the user's location and then call an external weather forecast API. Hopefully your scenario is similar to at least one of these examples and you can find a way of using Fulfill to separate the concerns of your developer and conversational analyst.\n\nIf you're inspired by this tutorial to develop your own actions, please consider submitting them to the Botmaster community through a Pull request.

Although I'm not too sure why one wouldn't just use MS Bot Framework without Botkit.\nMain article\nAlthough it might seem at first glance like the two frameworks (and other similar ones out there) were created with the same goal in mind, things are quite far from that. Let's have a look at how one of these frameworks compare, namely Botkit.\nBotkit was initially created to allow developers to easily build bots of all types that would be available on Slack. Although it now allows developers to build bots for twilio IP messaging and Facebook Messenger too. It was first published in December 2015\nBotmaster, on the other hand, is a lightweight framework created after answering the following question: How can I minimise the amount of code a developer has to write in order to create a 1-on-1 conversational chatbot that works on multiple different platforms. It was first published to Github on August 2016.\nDue to the differences in application intents between both frameworks, the design differs in many ways.\nMessage format\nBotkit's messages are only standardized to some extent. Because Botkit it not opinionated, it doesn't make any assumption on what a message attachments or message quick_replies should look like and what they would map to on different platform.\nThis means that a Facebook messenger message with an image attachments will look something like this:\n{\n  user: ,\n  channel: , // also\n  timestamp: ,\n  seq: ,\n  mid: ,\n  attachments: [\n    {\n      type: 'image',\n      payload: {\n        url: 'https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/.....'\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\nWhile a Twilio IPM message (Twilio IPM only supports text) will look like this:\n{ ChannelSid: ,\n  EventType: 'onMessageSent',\n  InstanceSid: ,\n  Attributes: '{}',\n  DateCreated: '2016-07-29T18:42:35.686Z',\n  Index: '1',\n  From: 'SneakyQuincyEssex',\n  MessageSid: ,\n  Identity: 'SneakyQuincyEssex',\n  Body: 'yo',\n  AccountSid: ,\n  text: 'yo',\n  from: 'SneakyQuincyEssex',\n  to: undefined,\n  user: 'SneakyQuincyEssex',\n  channel:  }\nBecause of the nature of Twilio and the nature of channels and how they are dealt with, this makes sense. We'll look at what other differences this brings in the next section.\nStandardization is at the heart of Botmaster. The framework was really created for that purpose. In order to do that, the Facebook Messenger message format was chosen and adopted. This means that when your botmaster object receives an 'update' event from anywhere (twitter, telegram as of this writing), you can be sure that it will be of the same format as a similar message that would come from Messenger.\nTypically, it would look something like this for a message with an image attachment. Independant of what platform the message comes from:\n{\n  raw: ,\n  sender: {\n    id: \n  },\n  recipient: {\n    id:  // will typically be the bot's id\n  },\n  timestamp: ,\n  message: {\n    mid: ,\n    seq: ,\n    attachments: [\n      {\n        type: 'image',\n        payload: {\n          url: 'https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/.....'\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n};\nThis allows developers to handle these messages in on place only rather than doing it in multiple ones.\nThe bot object\nConfusion may [and most likely will] arise when trying to understand how the bot objects returned with each message differ between both frameworks.\nBotkit has a concept of a controller. Controllers are not platform agnostic according to their definition. So for example a Twilio IPM controller will look like this:\nvar controller = Botkit.twilioipmbot({\n    debug: false,\n});\n\nThis controller could then spawn new Twilio IMP bots. Bots all have a fixed endpoint with a port that can be defined if you need multiple bots of the same type. The bot object is returned with every event and you can then do things like send a message or reply etc with it.\nFor messenger, it would look something like this:\nconst controller = Botkit.facebookbot({\n  access_token: messengerCredentials.pageToken,\n  verify_token: messengerCredentials.verifyToken,\n});\n\nNOTE: Because of the fixed endpoint and the fact that Botkit does not (according to their code as of Aug 18th 2016) verify the integrity of the requests using the Facebook App Secret, I would advise against using it as this means that anyone can make a request to https://YOUR_SERVER_URL:PORT_CHOSEN/facebook/receive and fake requests from Facebook.\nOf course, you can have multiple controllers in your app. But you will have to manage the various types of incoming messages.\nBotmaster does not have this concept of a controller. In fact, if you are coming from Botkit, you can think of Botmaster as a sort of supercontroller from which you can create a bot of any type as in this example:\n\n// just an example to show what types of settings are expected\nconst otherMessengerSettings = {\n  credentials: {\n    verifyToken: messengerCredentials.verifyToken,\n    pageToken: messengerCredentials.pageToken, // access_token in Botkit\n    fbAppSecret: messengerCredentials.fbAppSecret,\n  },\n  webhookEndpoint: '/webhook_some_random_string',\n}\n\nconst botsSettings = [{ telegram: telegramSettings }, // settings found elsewhere\n                      { messenger: messengerSettings }, // settings found elsewhere\n                      { messenger: otherMessengerSettings },\n                      { twitter: twitterSettings},]; // settings found elsewhere\n\nconst botmaster = new Botmaster({settings: botsSettings});\n\nBot objects are created under the hood and events received by each of them will be relayed to the Botmaster in the standardized Messenger format mentioned in the Message format part. Events are called updates and receiving them looks like this:\nbotmaster.on('update', (bot, update) => {\n});\n\nWhere the bot object would have been created with any of the 4 settings mentioned. Note the fact that there are 2 messenger settings. Because Botmaster requires an endpoint to be specified in the settings, nothing more than specifying it has to be done there. We recommend people to include some sort of a key in their endpoint as added security for Messenger (on top of the integrity verification from the Facebook app secret) and as basic security for Telegram.\nWorking with webhooks\nIn order to receive messages, some platforms make the use of webhooks. Which means they will send requests to some endpoints on your server. In order to do that, both frameworks make the use of express() app objects under the hood. Botkit does so for Messenger, Twilio IPM and some of the Slack solutions. Botmaster does do for Messenger and Telegram (for now).\nThe standard way to deal with this in Botkit is the following:\nconst port = 3000;\n\ncontroller.setupWebserver(port, function(err, webserver) {\n  controller.createWebhookEndpoints(webserver)\n});\n\nAs you can see, this will create an express() webserver and send it onto the createWebhookEndpoints function. The server will now listen onto the facebook/receive endpoint on port 3000 if it is a Messenger controller. It will listen onto the '/twilio/receive' for Twilio IPM and '/slack/receive' for Slack (if using one of the services that uses webhooks).\nOf course, you might want to use your own express() app webserver to use accross multiple controllers or to serve all sorts of other purposes. You would do this like that in Botkit:\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\n\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));\n.\n.\n.\ncontroller.createWebhookEndpoints(app, bot, () => {\n    console.log('This bot is online!!!');\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, function() {\n  console.log('Server up');\n});\n\nIn Botmaster, instantiating a botmaster object, will by default just start an express server under the hood for you and make it listen onto port 3000. If you want it to listen onto another port, you can just do something like this when instantiating botmaster:\nconst port = 3001;\nconst botmaster = new Botmaster({ settings: botsSettings,\n                                 port: port });\n\nThe webhook endpoints will be set according to your settings. Go to webhooks in the main readme to read some more about webhooks in Botmaster.\nIn order to use your own express app, you would do as follows in Botmaster.\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\n\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));\n.\n.\n.\nconst botmaster = new Botmaster({settings: botsSettings,\n                                 app: app});\n\napp.listen(3000, function() {\n  console.log('Server up');\n});\n\nBy default, Botkit will use different express app webservers for each controller. Botmaster, as mentioned earlier, is a sort of supercontroller. Because of that, it uses the same express webserver accross all channels by default.\nSupported Platforms\nThe following are platforms that are supported out of the box. Both frameworks allow developers to write their own integrations and npm packages might exist for the a platform you are interested in.\n\n\n\n\nBotmaster\nBotkit\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Messenger\nx\nx\n\n\nSlack\nx\nx\n\n\nTwilio IPM\n\nx\n\n\nTwitter DM\nx\n\n\n\nTelegram\nx\n\n\n\nWebSockets\nx\n\n\n\nMS Bot framework\n\nx\n\n\n\nConversations\nBotkit allows developers to specify a deterministic conversation flow within the code to simplify such flows. This is definitely handy and something that can help when creating Slack and Twilio bots\nBecause Botmaster was initialy built mainly as a standardization agnostic layer that assumes your messages will be sent to some sort of AI service like Watson Conversation and others, this hasn't been builtin to the first version. This is however something that will come soon (in a different form from the ones in Botkit). Depending on requests however, it could come sooner or later.\nConclusion\nI hope this all made some sort of sense to you and that you are now able to make a sensible decision with respect to which framework to use.\nI realize there are other frameworks out there too that I haven't mentioned. If anyone would like to look into them and tell me what the differences are, I'd be happy to add them to another file.\n"},"api-reference/":{"url":"api-reference/","title":"API reference","keywords":"","body":"API reference\nYou will find here the reference to all the exposed Botmaster API.\nThey are found within 3 classes: Botmaster, BaseBot and OutgoingMessage.

Use 3.1.1 instead of 3.1.0.\nMINOR 3.1.0\nWebhookEndpoints can now be specified either with pre-pending or trailing slash (Thanks to @Damell for that (https://github.com/botmasterai/botmaster/pull/26)).\nWebhook endpoints don't need to be prepended with the bot type anymore (request by @younes200 (https://github.com/botmasterai/botmaster/pull/23)).\nA new option was added for this in the botmaster controller. And it is used as such:\nconst botmaster = new Botmaster({\n  useDefaultMountPathPrepend: false,\n});\n\nBy doing this, if you setup a webhook using bot like the in the botmaster-messenger package as such:\nconst messengerSettings = {\n  credentials: someCredentials,\n  webhookEndpoint: 'webhook/endoint/1234',\n};\n\nYou would then be settings up your webhook in Messenger to be:\n/webhook/endpoint/1234 rather than /messenger/webhook/endpoint/1234\nNone of these changes should impact your code\nAnother change was made in the structure of botmaster, but that should not impact you unless you were accessing the private variable sendOptions.__update in your middleware. If so, know that it has been moved to bot.__associatedUpdate and have a look at the code that was part of this release.\nMAJOR 3.0.8\nBotmaster v3 is almost a complete rewrite of botmaster. Although much of the philosophy is the same, a lot of breaking changes have been introduced. Surely, you will find that they are for the better. This changelog doubles as a migration help.\n1. Upgrading to botmastser v3\nYou most likely have a line that looks like this in your package.json:\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"botmaster\": \"^2.x.x\",\n  }\n\nIn order to change that, either do a \nyarn upgrade botmaster\n\nif using yarn\nor:\nnpm install --save botmaster@3\n\nif using npm\nThis will change that line in your dependencies to something like:\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"botmaster\": \"^3.0.8\",\n  }\n\nOr newer if newer versions were released recently.\n2. Bot classes now have their own packages\nFirstly, all the bot classes have been taken out and put in their own packages. This means if you want to write a bot that only works on, say, socket.io and Messenger, you don't actually have the code for the other bot classes anymore. You would need to do something like this:\nyarn add botmaster\nyarn add botmaster-messenger\nyarn add botmaster-socket.io\n\nor if still using npm\nnpm install --save botmaster\nnpm install --save botmaster-messenger\nnpm install --save botmaster-socket.io\n\nthen in your code:\nconst Botmaster = require('botmaster');\nconst MessengerBot = require('botmaster-messenger');\nconst SocketioBot = require('botmaster-socket.io');\n.\n.\n.\n// then rest of code\n\nThe other bot classes that were available in 2.x.x can be found at:\nbotmaster-slack\nbotmaster-telegram\nbotmaster-twitter-dm\n3. Botmaster is not built on top of express anymore\nFirst of all, this is only important for you to note if you were using your own express app and not\nletting Botmaster create it for you. If that isn't your case, you won't need to change anything here.\nIn order to make Botmaster really flexible, moving away from a dependency on express was important.\nThis means that you can now either just let botmaster create its own server as it used to do via express in 2.x.x.\nOr, you can completely manage your own server (using express, koa, plain http or other).\nThis means that doing this will now throw an error:\n// DON'T DO THIS ANYMORE!!!\nconst Botmaster = require('botmaster');\nconst express = require('express');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst botmaster = new Botmaster({ app });\n\napp.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0', () => { // remember this creates an http server under the hood\n  console.log('My express app is listening and its server is used in Botmaster');\n})\n\nInstead, if you want to manage your own app object, you will need to do something like this\n// DO THIS INSTEAD!!\nconst Botmaster = require('botmaster');\nconst express = require('express');\n\nconst app = express();\nconst myServer = app.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0');\nconst botmaster = new Botmaster({ server: myServer });\n\nmyServer.on('listening', () => {\n  console.log('My express app is listening and its server is used in Botmaster');\n})\n\nNow, this might look like nothing much has changed, but here's why this is an important change. If instead of\nhaving an express app, you have a Koa app (or other), this will essentially still work as all that Botmaster now asks of you\nis an instance of http server.\n// DO THIS TO USE KOA!!\nconst Botmaster = require('botmaster');\nconst Koa = require('koa');\n\nconst app = new Koa();\nconst myServer = app.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0');\nconst botmaster = new Botmaster({ server: myServer });\n\nmyServer.on('listening', () => {\n  console.log('My Koa app is listening and its server is used in Botmaster too');\n})\n\nThis was not possible in Botmaster 2.x.x.\n4. Middleware\nThe biggest changes have been made with respect to middleware. Although your middleware functions will still work, they will need to be moved into a slightly new syntax.\nWhere you had something like this in 2.x.x:\nbotmaster.use('incoming', (bot, update, next) => {\n  // your stuff\n});\n\nYou will now have something like this in 3.x.x:\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'some-name-of-your-choosing', // this is optional, but nice for debugging\n  controller: (bot, update, next) => {\n    // your stuff\n  }\n});\n\nEssentially, the callback has been moved to a controller within an object that describes the middleware in general.\nYou'll need to do the same thing for your outgoing middleware.\nThis is what needs to be changed. However, the core of middleware has changes quite a bit. Middleware can now either use the old syntax using next (as it used to in 2.x.x). Or it can leverage newer syntax by returning a promise. I.e. this is now valid middleware\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'some-middleware',\n  controller: (bot, update) => {\n    return bot.reply(update, 'Hey there')\n    .then((body) => {\n      // this is run after the message is sent. I.e. also after all the outgoing middleware has been executed\n    })\n  }\n});\n\nThis means that you can now write your code in a very synchronous looking manner if using node 7+ and running node\nwith the --harmony-async-await flag or simply if you use a transpiler like Babel. Code like this will be valid\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'some-middleware',\n  controller: async (bot, update) => {\n    const body = await bot.reply(update, 'Hey there')\n    // this is run after the message is sent. I.e. also after all the outgoing middleware has been executed\n  }\n});\n\n\nIf returning a promise, using next within this promise will emit/throw an error depending on if you are in incoming or outgoing middleware. It will emit in incoming middleware and throw in outgoing middleware.\n\nPlease note that the returned promise's resolved value (whether you use async-await or not) will not be used\nI.e. if in the last example after the const body = ... line, you return any value. This will be used nowhere.\nLike in the old middleware, you are expected to make changes to the update object. Those changes will be available\nin the following middleware. All that botmaster assures you with is that the next middleware in the stack will be called\nonly after the promise from the previous one has resolved. Here's an example using promises:\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'first-middleware',\n  controller: (bot, update) => {\n    return useSomePromiseBasedFunction('something')\n    .then((valueFromFunction) => {\n      update.value = valueFromFunction;\n    })\n  }\n});\n\nbotmaster.use({\n  type: 'incoming',\n  name: 'second-middleware',\n  controller: (bot, update, next) => {\n    console.log(update.value); // prints valueFromFunction\n    next();\n  }\n});\n\nNote how in this example, we are mixing both types of syntax (using promises and next). This is completely fine and even\nsuggested if, say, your second middleware here is synchronous.\nAnother addition has been made to middleware. As it turns out, I lied when I said that values resolved by promise-based middleware will be ignored.\nThere are two cases where they won't be ignored. That's if you return skip or cancel.\nSee here to see how to use them.\nBotmaster 3 also add support for using the useWrapped method for adding middleware. This method when used\nwill add an incoming middleware at the beginning of the middleware incoming stack and another outgoing middleware at the end\nof the outgoing middeware stack. It'll look something like this:\nbotmaster.useWrapped(incomingMiddleware, outgoingMiddleware);\n\nWhere incomingMiddleware and outgoingMiddleware are valid middlewares of their respective types.\nThis is useful if writing a middleware package that want to be first to get the update object and last to see it when it goes out.\nIt is used in botmaster-session-ware for instance.\n5. .on('update') no longer exists.\nAs it says. You are now expected to move your code that lived in there to an incoming middleware. Should be the last one you declare\nso it is run at the end of all your incoming middleware.\n6. Bot classes are better defined.\nBot classes now come with 3 new settings that help you know whether you want to execute a middleware or not on an specific update from a bot.\nThey are:\nbot.receives. Will look something like this:\nthis.receives = {\n  text: false,\n  attachment: {\n    audio: false,\n    file: false,\n    image: false,\n    video: false,\n    location: false,\n    // can occur in FB messenger when user sends a message which only contains a URL\n    // most platforms won't support that\n    fallback: false,\n  },\n  echo: false,\n  read: false,\n  delivery: false,\n  postback: false,\n  // in FB Messenger, this will exist whenever a user clicks on\n  // a quick_reply button. It will contain the payload set by the developer\n  // when sending the outgoing message. Bot classes should only set this\n  // value to true if the platform they are building for has an equivalent\n  // to this.\n  quickReply: false,\n};\n\nbot.sends. Will look something like this:\nthis.sends = {\n  text: false,\n  quickReply: false,\n  locationQuickReply: false,\n  senderAction: {\n    typingOn: false,\n    typingOff: false,\n    markSeen: false,\n  },\n  attachment: {\n    audio: false,\n    file: false,\n    image: false,\n    video: false,\n  },\n};\n\nAll values will either be falsy or truthy. Ideally, they will even either be true or false.\nAnd bot.retrievesUserInfo which will either be truthy or falsy.\n7. OutgoingMessage class has been added\nIn order to make it easier to compose outgoing messages without having to mess about with the object directly, Botmaster\nnow sends instances of OutgoingMessage to the outgoing middleware. These objects are just like old message objects in 2.x.x.\n(go ahead, you can console log them to see for yourselves), but they just come with a few helper methods to add and remove\nstuff from the object. Have a look at the API reference for them to see how you can leverage that.\n8. SendMessage type methods\nThere are THREE big changes in the way the sendMessage type methods now work. \n1. You can't use them with callbacks anymore. The only supported way to do anything after the message is sent is to then them using promises.\nSo if you had code like this:\nbot.sendMessage(someMessage, (body) => {\n  console.log(body);\n});\n\nyou'll need to make it look like this:\nbot.sendMessage(someMessage).then((body) => {\n  console.log(body);\n});\n\nThis was done because forcing promises means that using async-await syntax will be a breeze with Botmaster.\nAnd async-await is the future. So we didn't want to have you miss on that.\n2. You can now use sendRaw with all bot classes\nAny bot class will have a valid sendRaw method (that is just sugar for the underlying Bot class's __sendMessage method). This method\nallows you to send a message to the platform your bot object is based from without going through any formatting or outgoing middleware.\nI.e. it could be used as such:\n// within a middleware controller\nif (bot.type === 'slack') { // for example\n  rawSlackMessage = {\n    token: 'someToken',\n    channel: 'someChannel',\n    as_user: true,\n    text: 'someText',\n    .\n    .\n    .\n  };\n\n  return bot.sendRaw(rawSlackMessage);\n} else {\n  return bot.reply(update, 'Thank you for subscribing');\n}\n\n3. The resolved body from sendMessage type functions now contains much more information. It is now composed of the following:\n\nsentOutgoingMessage - the object before going through its formatting\nsentRawMessage - the sentOutgoinMessage after its formatting\nraw - the raw response from the platform after sending the obejct\nrecipient_id - the id of the recipient\nmessage_id - the id of the sent message (if available)\n\nOn top of that the following two methods have changed:\n1. sendDefaultButtonMessageTo()\nNow has recipientId as last argument\n2. sendCascade()\nNow only accepts raw or full message objects. You are expected to compose the\nmessages you are sending with the OutgoingMessage helper methods\nHave a look at the api-reference to see examples of these methods now\n9. WebhookEndpoint has no initial slash anymore.\nWhen using a bot class that uses webhooks, no need to add a slash at the beginning of the webhookEnpoint paramter.\nI.e. if you had something that looked like this:\nconst messengerSettings = {\n  credentials: someCredentials,\n  webhookEndpoint: '/webhook1234',\n};\n\nChange it to:\nconst messengerSettings = {\n  credentials: someCredentials,\n  webhookEndpoint: 'webhook1234',\n};\n\nMINOR 2.3.0\nOutgoing middleware now has access to the incoming update. I.e. outgoing middleware can be used like this:\nbotmaster.use('outgoing', (bot, update, message, next) => {\n  console.log(update);\n  console.log(message);\n})\n\nPATCH 2.2.7\nAdd the concept of implements for bot classes. Now every bot object has a bot.implements object that specifies which functionalities are implemented by the bot class. Currently, the values that exist and can be tested against are:\nquickReply // for quick replies\nattachment // does it support attachments\ntyping // does it support typing status\nPATCH 2.2.6\nJust fix a bug in outgoing middleware\nPATCH 2.2.5\nThis patch adds to the body returned when using any of the bot.sendMessage type helper methods.\nNow the body also contains a body.sent_message parameter that is simply the full object that was sent by the bot\nPATCH 2.2.4\nThis patch allows users to use sendMessage type functions with an optional sendOptions object. Currently, this can be used to bypass outgoing middleware\nwhen sending messages by using the ignoreMiddleware option. Using this looks something like this:\nbot.reply(update, 'Hello world!', { ignoreMiddleware: true })\n\nor using a callback function\nbot.reply(update, 'Hello world!', { ignoreMiddleware: true }, (body) =>\n  console.log(body);\n);\n\nor for buttons\nbot.sendDefaultButtonMessageTo(\n  ['button1', 'button2'], sender.user.id, 'click on a button',\n  { ignoreMiddleware: true })\n\nor with cascade messages\nbot.sendTextCascadeTo(\n  ['message1', 'message2'], sender.user.id,\n  { ignoreMiddleware: true }, (bodies) => {\n\n  console.log(bodies);\n})\n\nPATCH 2.2.3\nThis patch adds support for the bot.sendCascadeTo and bot.sendTextCascadeTo methods. Allowing users to send a cascade of message with just one command rather than having to deal with that themselves. Read more about it here:\nhere\nPATCH: 2.2.2\nThis patch allows users to set the userId from a sender when using the bot socket.io class. socket now needs to be opened with something like this on the client side:\nvar socket = io('?botmasterUserId=wantedUserId');\n\nSee updated Botmaster Socket.io bot mini-tutorial here\nMINOR: Botmaster 2.2.0\nThis minor release allows developers to create news instances of Botmaster without bots settings by writing something like:\nconst Botmaster = require('botmaster');\nconst MessengerBot = Botmaster.botTypes.MessengerBot;\n.\n.\nconst botmaster = new Botmaster();\n.\n. // full settings objects omitted for brevity\n.\nconst messengerBot = new MessengerBot(messengerSettings);\nconst slackBot = new SlackBot(slackSettings);\nconst twitterBot = new TwitterBot(twitterSettings);\nconst socketioBot = new SocketioBot(socketioSettings);\nconst telegramBot = new TelegramBot(telegramSettings);\n\nbotmaster.addBot(messengerBot);\nbotmaster.addBot(slackBot);\nbotmaster.addBot(twitterBot);\nbotmaster.addBot(socketioBot);\nbotmaster.addBot(telegramBot);\n\nThis is because it might be viewed as cleaner by some to add bots in the following way rather than doing this in the constructor.\nPATCH: Botmaster 2.1.1\nThis patch fixes a bug whereby one couldn't instantiate a botmaster object that would use socket.io in all reasonably expected ways. See here for a discussion.\nMINOR: Botmaster 2.1.0\nThis version adds support for socket.io bots within the botmaster core. This is the last\nbot class that will be in the core\nMAJOR: Botmaster 2.0.0\nIn this new version, a lot of new things were added to Botmaster. A few others were removed.\nBreaking Changes\nIf you were using SessionStore in version 1.x.x, you won't be able to anymore in version 2.x.x. They have been scratched for the far more common middleware design pattern common in so many other frameworks (e.g. express). Middleware can be hooked into right before receiving an update and right before sending out a message. It fits ideally with people wanting to setup session storage at these points.\nAdding Slack\nSupport for Slack as the fourth channel supported by Botmaster has been added. Using the Events API, you can now send and receive messages on the platform.\nget User info\nIf the platform supports it and the bot class you are using supports it too, you can now use the bot.getUserInfo method to retrieve basic information on a user, including their name and profile pic.\nbug fixes\nAs with any release, a bunch of bugfixes were done.\n"}}}
