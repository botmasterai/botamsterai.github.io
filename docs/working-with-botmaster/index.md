# Working with Botmaster

The following secionts are meant to be read in order after having gone through the [quickstart](/getting-sarted/quickstart.md). Every section starts with the basic concepts on the topic and end with more advanced ones.

1. [Middleware](middleware.md) The first section is on middleware. As most of the code you'll be writing will
actually be in those, it makes sense to start with that topic.
